libjkiss - 64-bit KISS rng with pthread support

Build and install along the lines of:

  export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15
  export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
  autoreconf -i
  ./configure [--prefix=...] && make && make install


This is a public domain JLKISS64 implementation - a KISS pseudo-random
number generator (pRNG) with 64-bit operations and thread-independent
seeding. Each pthread will use a different seed set. The period of this
pRNG is ~2**250 so only extremely long-running threads that make
extremely heavy use of the pRNG will likely need to reseed. The caller
may supply a custom seed initialization function; otherwise, the seed is
set from arc4random(3) calls, or if that is not available, by reading
from a random device.

Linux systems may need to install libbsd and the appropriate development
bits for such, then ./configure with:

  --with-libbsd

Otherwise, lacking arc4random(3), the default seed function will try to
read from a random device (/dev/random by default). This file can be
adjusted at ./configure time with:

  --with-random-device=/dev/urandom
