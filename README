libjkiss - 64-bit KISS rng with pthread support

Build and install along the lines of:

  export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15
  export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
  autoreconf -i
  ./configure [--prefix=...] && make && make install


The primary functions of this library are jkiss_init() and jkiss_rand();
the first of these should be called once, perhaps in the main thread
before the others are started, and the second is used to obtain a random
value. Each thread will use its own seed, set randomly via arc4random(3)
or via the /dev/random device. The period of this RNG function is ~
2**250, so repeats due to long running processes that make heavy use of
the RNG are unlikely. Consult jkiss(3) for additional documentation.
