libjkiss - 64-bit KISS rng with pthread support

this is a public domain JLKISS64 implementation - a KISS pseudo-random
number generator (pRNG) with 64-bit operations and thread-independent
seeding. each pthread will use a different seed set. the period of this
pRNG is ~2**250 so only extremely long-running threads that make
extremely heavy use of the pRNG will likely need to reseed. the caller
may supply a custom seed initialization function; otherwise, the seed is
set from arc4random(3) calls, or if that is not available, by reading
from a random device

build and install along the lines of

    unset CFLAGS
    export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.16
    export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure [--prefix=...] && make && make install

highly recommended is the --enable-the-rpath flag (or on macOS
--enable-macos-rpath) to avoid the need for LD_LIBRARY_PATH tomfoolery:

    ./configure --enable-the-rpath \
      --prefix=$HOME/usr/`uname``uname -r`-`uname -m`
    make && make install

lacking arc4random(3) the default seed function will try to read from a
random device (/dev/urandom by default). this file can be adjusted at
configure time with:

    --with-random-device=...
