libjkiss - 64-bit KISS rng with pthread support

Build and install along the lines of:

    unset CFLAGS
    export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15
    export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure [--prefix=...] && make && make install

This is a public domain JLKISS64 implementation - a KISS pseudo-random
number generator (pRNG) with 64-bit operations and thread-independent
seeding. Each pthread will use a different seed set. The period of this
pRNG is ~2**250 so only extremely long-running threads that make
extremely heavy use of the pRNG will likely need to reseed. The caller
may supply a custom seed initialization function; otherwise, the seed is
set from arc4random(3) calls, or if that is not available, by reading
from a random device.

Mac OS X systems may need to remove

    -Wl,-rpath=${libdir}

from the jkiss.pc.in file before building this library, or to manually
remove that string for anything compiled against this library:

    $ pkg-config --cflags --libs jkiss
    -I.../include -L.../lib -Wl,-rpath=.../lib -ljkiss
    $ export CFLAGS="-I.../include -L.../lib -ljkiss"
    $ make somethingelse...

Linux systems may need to install libbsd and the appropriate development
bits for such, then ./configure with:

    --with-libbsd

Otherwise lacking arc4random(3) the default seed function will try to
read from a random device (/dev/random by default). This file can be
adjusted at ./configure time with:

    --with-random-device=/dev/urandom
